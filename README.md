# Noosa's World v2

I'm remaking the [original version](https://noosas-world.netlify.app) of Noosa's World with **webpack** and **TypeScript**! This will allow me to dwelve deep into the Object-Oriented paradigms and build up my expertise with TypeScript. If you're interested about the legacy code, you can find the [original repository here](https://github.com/raphpion/noosas-world).

## Getting Started

This project uses Yarn as its package manager. The following commands are available:

- `yarn dev` runs the project in development mode.

- `yarn prod` runs the project in production mode.
